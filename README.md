# Emonda-SL-6
Ã‰monda SL 6 Disc has all the advantages of an ultralight carbon road bike, with the added benefit of aero tube shaping that will make you faster on flats and up climbs, too. A performance drivetrain and front and rear thru axles make it a great choice for fast roadies who want the extra confidence of disc brakes that perform in any conditions.
